- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @AgentLito
- I believe that my occupational experience and personal brand align squarely with the Senior Analyst role. With my extensive Information Technology (IT) experience, I am adept in data analytics/reporting, automation/software testing, project management, and customer service. I also offer Tableau/Jira dashboard creation and SharePoint experience.

My data analytics and Dale Carnegie certifications have equipped me with the tools and concepts to identify meaningful insights and effectively communicate them. My educational background entails a M.B.A. and B.A. in Business Administration; relevant coursework includes information systems, business strategy, and organizational behavior.

I can devise inventive solutions to even the most arduous of problems. I stand by the quote, ‚Äúevery problem has a solution; it may sometimes just need another perspective.‚Äù I look forward to the opportunity of meeting you so that I may further discuss my skills.
